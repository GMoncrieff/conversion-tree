            <h2>Spatial Allocation of Conversion Threat</h2>
            
            <p>The <strong>allocation</strong> (or vulnerability) component of conversion threat forecasting identifies <em>where</em> change is most likely to occur within your study area. Once you have estimated total demand, this spatial allocation distributes that threat across the landscape based on factors that make certain locations more susceptible to conversion or degradation.</p>
            
            <p>Vulnerability assessment typically considers multiple drivers of change:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biophysical factors:</strong> Slope, elevation, soil quality, climate conditions</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Distance to roads, markets, and urban centers</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic factors:</strong> Population density, economic development, land tenure</li>
                <li><strong>Policy and governance:</strong> Protected areas, zoning regulations, land use policies</li>
                <li><strong>Historical patterns:</strong> Past locations of land cover change</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Vulnerability maps can be created through statistical models (e.g., logistic regression, machine learning), expert knowledge, or by using historical change patterns as a proxy for future vulnerability. The choice of approach depends on your data availability and whether past drivers of change are expected to continue influencing future patterns.</p>
            
            <p>The following questions will help determine the best approach for assessing vulnerability in your study area.</p>
