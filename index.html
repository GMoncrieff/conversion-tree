            <h2>Welcome to the Conversion Threat Forecasting Decision Tool</h2>
            
            <p>Conservation resources are inherently limited, necessitating their efficient allocation to maximize impact. Conservation planning is increasingly proactive, seeking to anticipate future change rather than react to losses after they occur. Among the key factors influencing conservation decisions—such as economic costs, feasibility of protection, and the distribution of biodiversity—the level of threat to conservation features plays a crucial role. Areas facing imminent habitat loss or degradation may be prioritized for immediate action to prevent irreversible damage.</p>
            
            <p>Incorporating future threats into conservation decision-making requires being explicit about your assumptions regarding the evolution of threats in time and their distribution in space. <strong>Ex-ante threat assessments</strong>—those conducted prior to land-use change—provide forecasts of the location, timing, and intensity of factors contributing to biodiversity loss. These assessments may be based on statistical extrapolations of historical trends, development scenarios, or spatially explicit models.</p>
            
            <p>This decision tool guides you through selecting the most appropriate approach for your conversion threat forecast based on three key considerations:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pathway Selection:</strong> Determining your modeling approach based on whether you're forecasting conversion or degradation, and at what spatial scale</li>
                <li><strong>Demand Assessment:</strong> Quantifying how much land cover change is expected (the total area or rate of change)</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability/Allocation Assessment:</strong> Identifying where land cover change is most likely to occur (spatial distribution of threat)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By answering a series of questions about your data availability, study area, and modeling objectives, you'll receive tailored recommendations for forecasting approaches and software tools that best fit your conservation planning needs.</p>
